# ðŸŽ‰ Inspiration

I created this project after learning the following:

 - What are React, JSX & component tree
 - How and why do we need to import React, ReactDOM & other files in React project
 - How to pass data in components from parent to child components using props
 - How to render list using the array map method
 - How destructuring of object works in JavaScript

I felt like testing my knowledge by challenging myself to apply it to some project of my own.

# ðŸŒŸ Showcase 

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration of fundamental concepts in React development, including React, JSX, component trees, data passing using props, rendering lists, and JavaScript object destructuring.
