## âœ¨ Getting Started:

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/wasimapinjari/react-artist-catalogue.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm start`
4. You probably don't need to do this step because npm start will automatically open this project in the default browser but if it don't for some reason then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the project in action.
5. **Debug:** If you are already running a React app in the port **3000** the webpack (tool use by react to create local React development environment) will assign you a different port number usually by adding one to the current port number in use. In this case the new port number will be 3000 + 1 = 3001. So navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to see the project.

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with different components, and modify them to suit your needs. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

## ðŸŽ‰ Inspiration

I created this project because I felt like testing my knowledge by challenging myself to apply it to some project of my own and I did. It brings me immense joy to craft something that looks the absolute best.
